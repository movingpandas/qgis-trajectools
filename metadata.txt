description=Processing tools for handling trajectory data 
about=Trajectools adds trajectory analysis algorithms to the QGIS Processing toolbox. Trajectools requires MovingPandas >= 0.22.3 and optionally integrates scikit-mobility (for privacy tests), stonesoup (for smoothing), and gtfs_functions (for GTFS data support). See the plugin homepage for installation recommendations. Sample data for testing the functionality is provided with the plugin download.
